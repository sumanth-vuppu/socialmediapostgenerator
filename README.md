**Project Title**

Automated Instagram Content Generator & Uploader

---

## Overview

A Python script that leverages Google Gemini (gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) for both text and image generation, Cloudinary for image storage, and the Instagram API for automated content posting. It also sends status notifications to Slack via incoming webhooks.

Key features:

* **Text Generation:** Uses Gemini for dynamic captions and post content.
* **Image Generation:** Uses Gemini to create relevant visuals for posts.
* **Image Hosting:** Uploads generated images to Cloudinary and retrieves the hosted URLs.
* **Instagram Upload:** Publishes the generated content to Instagram.
* **Slack Notifications:** Posts success or failure messages to a Slack channel.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* Pip
* A Cloudinary account
* An Instagram account with a valid Instagram Graph API access token
* A Slack workspace with an incoming webhook URL
* Access to Google Gemini API

Edit `prompts.py` to customize the content prompts. The prompts are stored in a dictionaryâ€”feel free to tweak them to suit your style.

Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

> **Deployment Tip:**
> Deploy the script to a cloud server (e.g., AWS EC2, Google Cloud Compute) and schedule it via cronjobs or a similar task scheduler for automated recurring posts.

## Customization

* **Refine Responses:** Open `gemini_ai.py` and adjust the `contents` variable to fine-tune how the Gemini model generates text and images.
* **Add New Platforms:** Extend the script to support other social media platforms by following the existing modular structure.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **API Errors:** Ensure all environment variables are correctly set and valid.
* **Network Issues:** Confirm that your server or local machine has internet access and is not blocked by firewalls.
* **Cloudinary Upload Failures:** Check your Cloudinary usage quotas and permissions.
